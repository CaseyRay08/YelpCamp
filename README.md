coding progress/ projects
Completed the Colt Steele Full Web Dev BootCamp course on Udemy. 
This project we were to create a yelpcamp website that would allow users to register, login, add and view campgrounds around USA.
I used HTML, CSS, JS, EJS, Node, Express, MongoDB(local) MongoDB Atlas, Cloudinary(picture storage), Heroku(deployment), several Middleware like passport, Helmet. 
I'm sure I'm forgetting things like bootstrap and what not but this was my first big step into the developer world.
To me this was a very big project especially because it is a full stack. Yes Colt showed me a step by step process.
so I cannot claim this to be 100% mine but I've learned so much.
